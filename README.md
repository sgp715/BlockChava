# BlockChava

## Descripton
Just wanted to learn more about these fancy block chains that everyone was talking about. This is a simple implementation in Java. Also learning Java, Spring Boot and Gradle at the same time. So, pretty fun. It was largely based on the implementation in [this blog](https://medium.com/@lhartikk/a-blockchain-in-200-lines-of-code-963cc1cc0e54#.w7ahqpe7k).

## Install 
* Run the gradle build script
```
$ ./gradlew build
```

## Run
coming soon...
